This is a personal project built with Next.js to explore and practice modern web development while creating a movie search website. The goal of this project is to enhance my skills and add a meaningful project to my portfolio.

* Filter by Genre: Allows users to filter search results based on selected genres.
 
* Sort Results: Provides sorting options based on popularity and title.
 
* Movie Details: Displays relevant information for each movie, including title, overview, and poster.
